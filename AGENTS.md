I want to build a full-stack pizza delivery web application with the following requirements:

💻 Frontend:

Use React.js (or Next.js) for the frontend.

The UI should resemble Zomato in terms of design, user experience, and responsiveness.

Must include pages for:

Home page with featured pizzas, offers, and categories

Menu page with filter/sort functionality

Product detail page with add-to-cart

Cart page with quantity control and total price

Checkout page with delivery info and payment options (fake/mock)

Order tracking page

User authentication (Login/Register, JWT-based or similar)

Admin panel for managing orders, menu items, and offers

🧠 Backend:

Use Node.js + Express.js (or a suitable backend framework)

REST API or GraphQL support for:

User registration/login (JWT or session-based)

CRUD operations for menu items, categories, offers

Cart and order management

Admin routes for managing users and orders

Order tracking logic

🗄️ Database:

Use MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) for storing user info, orders, menu, etc.

🔐 Authentication:

Use JWT for secure API access

Role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. customer)

🎨 UI/UX:

Clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly design

Use a modern UI framework like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or similar

Animations, hover effects, and clear visual hierarchy like Zomato

🧪 Extra Features (Optional but Preferred):

Real-time order status updates using Socket.io

Address suggestions via Google Maps API

Rating and review system for pizzas

Email notifications for order status

PWA support for mobile usage
